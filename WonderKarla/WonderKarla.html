        <h3>WonderKarla</h3>
        <p>
          This game is typically in the fictional Codaisseur Kingdom with our
          amazing teacher Karla as the protagonist.
        </p>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          As a platform game, the player runs and jumps across platforms and
          atop enemies in coding themed levels. The game includes a multitude of
          power-ups and items that give Karla special powers such as
          size-changing into a giant.
        </p>
        <h3>Game Goal</h3>
        <p>
          The main aim of this game is to get as many points as possible by
          collecting items, destroying enemies and beating levels. There are
          various enemies WonderKarla should avoid; Red React and Evil Redux. If
          she gets hit by an enemy, the game is over. However, she can jump on
          enemies to destroy them and collect extra points. When WonderKarla
          head-bumps a Discord box, she could get different items; a Codaisseur
          point card, which gives 1 score point, or a React Boost, which gives
          her 1 point and superpowers for 6 seconds. The superpower makes
          WonderKarla bigger and gives her the ability to jump higher and
          destroy enemies with a touch. At the end of the level, WonderKarla can
          enter the next stage via the Database pipeline.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <strong>Caution:</strong> There is an Evil Redux rain during the game,
        which gets stronger when proceeding from a level to another. You can
        hear them spawn by listening to their growl.
        <h3>Controls</h3>
        <p>
          left and right arrow to walk, space to jump and down-arrow to enter a
          Database pipeline.
